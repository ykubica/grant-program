### Overview

Please provide the following:
- The system aims to create an original, hardcore, online card collecting game executed on the VeChain Network. The goal for the project is to maintain a website/web application   selling digital cards to users, creating a steady income with potential profits. Users will benefit from various bonuses for collecting and completing card sets.
- Our team has been supportive of Vechain since 2017, we each own a small portion of VET and VTHO and are passionate about the success of the project. We believe the two token     system is at a unique selling point in the world of blockchains, as it allows organisations to produce affordable tokens when comparing to other platforms such as Ethereum. We   believe that Vechain has a lot of potential and we feel that Vechain is still in it's early stages of development. Vechain is our oganisation of choice for dapp development     and we are excited to see the developments in dev tools in the future.
- We would like users to be able to use thor and connex to purchase NFT trading cards. We would also like users to be able to trade and purchase each others cards.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- We have additional documentation available to view here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mlP2xs8yTeQvb561k-SYdeMQTigv7lNX?usp=sharing

## Development Roadmap 

- We would like to have our first iteration of the system launched by Q1 2022.
  This will include around 150 unique NFTs available for purchase on our marketplace.
  Users will have their own collection area to view their owned cards
- The relinquished system will be completed by Q1 2023
- During the time, we will think of more ways to make the cards usable, such as implementation of a game, etc.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:
